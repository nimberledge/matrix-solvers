## Matrix Library
This project describes a library that can be used to solve linear systems (Ax=b). The source code is mainly 
contained in the Matrix.h and Matrix.cpp files, with an example in main.cpp. Sparse matrices are implemented in CSRMatrix.h / CSRMatrix.cpp. Code relating to the user interface is contained in Interface.h / Interface.cpp.

We started by writing a Jacobi solver for dense matrices, followed by a Cholesky solver for dense matrices. The latter involved implementing a triangular solve. We then implemented the CSR Matrix class, with its own triangular solver. We then added 2 iterative solvers for it. More information on the solver methods and development process can be found in the Project Report.

### Functionality implemented
    * Github workflow actions to compile and run the test suite and benchmarks on a remote Linux system
    * Reading / Writing Dense and Sparse Matrices to file
    * Printing the matrix to stdout and printing values (1D) to stdout
    * Storing a sparse matrix in CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) form, and modifying it
    * Solving a dense system with a Symmetric Positive-Definite Matrix (SPD) using a Cholesky Decomposition
    * Solving a dense system with an iterative Jacobi method
    * Solving a sparse (CSR) triangular system with dense RHS vector (b)
    * Solving a sparse (CSR) upper triangular system with sparse RHS vector (b)
    * Solving a diagonally dominant sparse system with an iterative Jacobi method
    * Solving a sparse Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) system with an iterative Krylov Subspace Method (Conjugate Gradient)
    * Working interface to allow a user to solve a dense or sparse linear system

## Matrix File Formats
For normal matrix files, the file format is as follows - 
1. Line 1 will have the number of rows, then a tab space, then the number of columns
2. Line 2 will have the tab-spaced values of each entry in row-major format, i.e all elements of row 0 before any elements of row 1

For example, 

        [ 1  2   3  4 ]
    A = [ 5  6   7  8 ]
        [ 9  10  11 12 ]
        [ 13 14  15 16 ]

would look like

For CSR matrix files, the format is as follows - 
1. Line 1 will have the number of rows, number of columns, and the number of non-zeros each separated by a tab-space
2. Line 2 -> nnz+1 will have 3 values, the row index, the column index, and the data value at that index

For example a sparse matrix,

        [ 1  0  3 ]
    A = [ 0  2  0 ]
        [ 0  0  4 ]

would look like

## Compiling and Running
The code can be compiled from the top-level directory by executing

```make```

This will compile the executable in ```src/main.cpp``` and deposit an executable named ```main``` in the ```bin/``` directory. You can then run the executable by typing

```bin/main```

This file shows an example solve using some of the many matrices provided in our ```data/``` directory. To use the interactive user interface, run

```make interactive```

```bin/ladsSolve```

To run the test suite, type 

```make test```

and it will compile the test suite automatically. test1 is for dense matrix functionality, test2 for sparse matrix functionality, and test3 for interface functionality.

To run a benchmark test on your system, run

```make benchmark```

```bin/benchmark```

The benchmarks are run on large matrices generated by a somewhat documented Python script, found in the ```tools/``` directory of the repository.

## Demonstrations
